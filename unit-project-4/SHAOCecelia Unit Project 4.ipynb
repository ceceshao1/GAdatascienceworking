Another more shaky assumption (which I would confirm by actually exploring the data) is there would be negative (left) skew in the data since most applicants to graduate schools would be people who performed relatively well in school (relatively higher GPAs) and want to put their best foot forward in terms of GRE scores (wouldn't submit a score that's objectively poor).

    "**Answer:** Our analysis helped me understand the relationship between levels of prestige and the chances of admissions (provided evidence towards a hypothesis that has been an unspoken truth that prestige matters and the admissions process is not entirely meritocratic). The analysis did not deeply cover the relationship between different levels of gpa and gre (although we do have the start with the coefficients). There were still limitations around lack of information on how this data was collected and how prestige is assigned (especially if those assignments change over time). For future steps, I would be curious to get this information around how the data was collected and also seeing if there were other variables to consider as part of my analysis, along with trying to see what the applicant's entire profile (gpa, gre, prestige all together) impact on admissions are (as opposed to hold one constant)."
