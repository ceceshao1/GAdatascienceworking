DS | Unit Project 4

### PROMPT

In this project, you will summarize and present your analysis from Projects 1-3. Your goal is to complete your ongoing Jupyter Notebook, combining updated deliverables from projects 1-3 with new and final analysis using classification models and evaluation metrics learned in the last weeks. 

This will be a final overview of your analysis that incorporates past feedback and demonstrates your understanding of each important phase of the data pipeline, from describing the problem statement and presenting an overview of the data, to walking the reader through the EDA, modeling, results and visualizations of the evaulation of the model.

**Goal:** Write up an executive summary piece that outlines your problem, the modeling process, your findings and describes all the methods used for each (borrowing heavily from projects 1-3).

### DELIVERABLES

#### Jupyer Notebook with Responses to Every Question

- **Requirements:**
    -  Problem Statement & Data Overview
    -  Outline of models and methods used
    -  Articulation of data distributions, transformations, limitations
    -  A exploratory data analysis overview with visualizations and statistical analysis (keep brief, and any additional plots can be in the Appendix)
    -  A writeup on the interpretation of findings and evaluation of the model, including conclusions and next steps

- **Tips:**
    - Always consider your audience - what do they already know vs. what should you define or explain?
    - Visualize your findings! Use charts, graphs, or other images as appropriate.

### TIMELINE

| Deadline | Deliverable| Description |
|:-:|---|---|
| Lesson 11 | Project 4  | Notebook with Analysis & Conclusions   |

### EVALUATION

Your project will be assessed using the following standards:

1. Notebook Submission Alignment with Expectations
2. Professional Development

#### Rubric: [Click here for the complete rubric](./project4-rubric.md).

Requirements for these standards will be assessed using the scale below:

    |Score | Expectations|
    |--- | ---|
    |**0** | _Incomplete._|
    |**1** | _Does not meet expectations._|
    |**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_|
    |**3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_|

While your total score may serve as a helpful gauge of whether you've met project goals, __specific standards scores are more important__ since they can show you where to focus your efforts in the future!

### RESOURCES

#### Dataset  
We'll be using the same dataset as UCLA's Logistic Regression in R tutorial to explore logistic regression in Python, as explained in [yhat's blog](http://blog.yhat.com/posts/logistic-regression-python-rodeo.html). This is an excellent resource for using logistic regression and summary statistics to explore a relevant dataset. Our goal is to identify the various factors that may influence admission into graduate school. It contains four variables- admit, gre, gpa, rank.

- 'admit' is a binary variable. It indicates whether or not a candidate was admitted admit =1) our not (admit= 0)
- 'gre' is GRE score
- 'gpa' stands for Grade Point Average
- 'rank' is the rank of an applicant's undergraduate alma mater, with 1 being the highest and 4 as the lowest

Dataset: [Admissions.csv](./assets/admissions.csv)

#### Starter code
Open the Jupyter Notebook **project4-starter.ipynb** and follow the questions provided.

#### Suggestions for Getting Started

- Review your previous work and incorporate prior feedback.
- Look up sample executive summaries online to get a feel for good data science presentations.
