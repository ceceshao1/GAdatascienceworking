    "**Answer:** Outliers in the data can effect the value of the mean of the dataset by \"artifically\" bumping the mean up if its a higher outlier or dragging the mean down if its a lower outlier. Outliers could contain valuable information or they could be meaningless aberrations caused by errors from measurement. Either way, it's important to set a reasonable threshold for what is defined as a threshold since outliers can either be mild or extreme (and then identify outliers as we do in (3b) below to track them) and also make sure to gauge the sample size of the dataset to see the potential impact of outliers (since smaller sample sizes are disproportionately effected by outliers).\n",

When multicolinearity exists in a dataset, small changes in the data can cause large changes in the model (i.e. coefficient values), making model interpretation very difficult. "

    "The final assumption that many have examined with the admissions.csv data is that we only have data for a small selection of students: those with good enough grades and high enough GRE to be applying to grad schools. So this data already has selection bias. We don't know that we have perfect cross section of how all students with full range of GRE and GPAs would fare, becuase we only see students who are doing well enough to apply in the first place. This is only important for regression, where we are asking the model to give us a coefficient that explains what power GRE has in the admissions decision, but we only really get an answer that explains its power among pretty successful students. We can't generalize the resulting coefficients back to all students because of the selection bias."
